## About Me

Hello! I am Swarnabha, an enthusiastic Data Scientist and developer with a passion for problem-solving and a deep love for computer science and engineering. My journey in data science has been a thrilling adventure, where I solve complex problems and uncover insights, creating impactful, data-driven solutions.

I find solace in music; I play the electronic keyboard and enjoy creating music that resonates with the soul. When not immersed in data or music, you'll find me playing table tennis, reading, exploring new restaurants, or traveling.
